### **About Andy Enhanced**

Everything from Andy plus :

### BETTER PAGINATOR
Borred about "Previous/Next" link for paginator ? Now real buttons with pretty pagination.

### USE ALL SCREEN SPACE
Why loosing screen space ? Just use everything usable.

### FASTER CSS & JS LOADING
With using async.

### BETTER W3C COMPLIANCE
Not perfect but better than the original (unique id are unique, better syntaxes, some cleaning...).
